A user who calls this may have their Jira .env in /Users/_name_/AI/config/jira.env
This is because we do not want these commited to our codebase as they are use specific .envs, and if they are .gitignored, they cannot be read by agents.
Please use these details when accessing Jira

You can get a users current Jira ticket from their Branch name, which should start with the board ID and the ticket number. Using their jira.env details, please fetch their Jira ticket, the description, and any subtasks.

Your aim is to read the jira ticket and all sub tasks, and then work with the user to plan their work, or look at the work done by the user and assess whether it matches the ticket.
