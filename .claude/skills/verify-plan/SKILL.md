# Verify Plan (pre-build loop)

Before building, check that the plan is actually complete and correct. This encodes the iteration a
developer would otherwise do by hand before `/next`. Proportional to task size — for a trivial
task, a quick pass; for a complex one, be thorough.

## Critique the plan against

- **The research** — does the plan address what research found (affected files, patterns,
  constraints, shared schemas/types that need updating)? Anything research flagged but the plan
  ignores is a gap.
- **The acceptance criteria** — does every criterion map to at least one subtask? Is there a subtask
  whose only job is to make an untested criterion verifiable?
- **Shape** — subtasks atomic/ordered/buildable (see the `writing-plans` skill); dependencies
  correct; nothing missing (migrations, schema/type updates, tests); nothing out of scope smuggled
  in.

Fix genuine gaps in `plan.md` directly; surface real trade-offs or unknowns to the user rather than
guessing.

## Draft acceptance criteria if missing

If neither the ticket nor the plan has acceptance criteria (or there's no clear way to verify the
work), **draft a testable set**. If you can't even draft one from the research and ticket, apply the
`clarify` skill to get what you need rather than fabricating criteria. Then ask:

> The ticket has no acceptance criteria — here's a draft. Add them to the ticket (best, so testers
> can verify later), or keep them local to the plan?

If the user picks the ticket, use the `ticket-tracker` agent to post them. Either way, record them
in `plan.md` under `## Acceptance Criteria` so `verify-acceptance` can check against them.

## Output

A short note: gaps found and fixed, ACs drafted (and where they were stored), and any open
questions for the user — then hand back to `/signoff`.
