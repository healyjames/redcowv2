### Optional modules

These are installed and tailored to your project by `/install`. Only the modules you
set up appear; run `/install` (or `/install <module>`) to add a skipped one later.

| Command              | Module        | Description                                            |

| `/dashboard`         | observability | Design a monitoring dashboard from your log/metric data|
| `/audit`             | audit         | Deep multi-dimension audit → actionable issue files    |
| `/audit-fix`         | audit         | Implement fixes from one audit dimension file          |
| `/changelog`         | release       | Generate a changelog from git history                  |
| `/release`           | release       | Changelog + version bump across all packages           |
| `/secret`            | secrets       | Add/manage a secret in your secrets manager            |

### Tips

- You don't need to call `/dev`, `/present`, or `/signoff` directly — `/next` and `/begin` orchestrate these for you. `/signoff` runs automatically after planning and presents clickable file links for you to review.
- All plan and research files live in `.claude/temp/` — clean up after your PR is merged
- Optional modules are opt-in. Re-running `/install` re-offers any module you skipped, so you can grow the workflow as the project needs it.
- Skills (`.claude/skills/`) hold the review/security/testing/verification rubrics; commands call them for you — you don't invoke skills directly. `/dev` self-verifies (build/lint/test + acceptance criteria) before the approval gate.
- The workflow evolves with you: run `/customize` to add/update a skill/command/agent — and Claude will suggest it when it notices you repeating the same request.
```

## Rules

- This command is informational only — it never modifies anything
- Present the guide clearly and ask if the user has questions
