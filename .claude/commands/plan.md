# Planning Phase

## Prerequisites

Requires existing research.md. If not found:

```
No research.md found.
Run /research first, or /begin for full workflow.
```

## Instructions

Find the current task directory (using our task <slug>, or the most recent folder in .claude/temp/ with research.md but no plan.md).
If a plan.md already exists, check it is correct for the task description and then run /resume. If it is not complete or not correct, ask the user to manually review.
If no plan exists, run the `planner` agent to create the implementation plan:

- Input: research.md + task description + existing plan if it exists
- Output: `.claude/temp/<slug>/plan.md`

## What the Planner Does

1. Reads research.md to understand context
2. Breaks work into subtasks (small, committable steps)
3. Defines goals and files for each subtask
4. Creates trackable checklists
5. At any point where there are unknowns or clarifications needed, pause to prompt the user for more information

## Optional Integrations

### Memory MCP (if configured)

Before spawning the planner agent, briefly check Memory MCP for planning-relevant context:

```
Use `search_nodes` with: architecture, decision, constraint, preference
Pass any relevant memories to the planner agent in the prompt.
```

If Memory MCP is not available, skip this step - the planner will work from research.md.

### Jira (if configured)

If a Jira ticket is referenced or can be derived from the branch name, fetch ticket details using /jira. If Jira credentials are not configured, skip this step.

## Testing

For large tasks, add unit-test subtasks where appropriate, as their own subtasks.
For small tasks, add a final unit-test subtask to add unit tests at the end.

## After Planning

```
Plan created: .claude/temp/<slug>/plan.md

<N> subtasks planned:
1. <subtask 1 title>
2. <subtask 2 title>
...

Run /signoff to review and approve.
```

## Rules

- Use the planner agent - don't create plan manually
- Research must exist first
- Each subtask should be small and committable
- Claude should NEVER commit without explicit user permission
- After completing a subtask, suggest a commit message and wait for user to commit
- Ask clarifying questions if approach is genuinely ambiguous
- Always check for a plan first and carry on from wherever we stopped work last
- Always track the work we have done in the plan so we can stop and start work as needed
- Stop and prompt the user rather than making assumptions on unknowns or areas of clarification
